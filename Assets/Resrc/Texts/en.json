Click on stop to cancel if the execution gets stuck\n5. If you don't win after the timeline finishes, you have to click on Reset\n6. Change to bytecode editor to write the raw code! That might be faster if you know the symbols! (To learn them, simply click on the transliterate button after making a program in the timeline)" }
